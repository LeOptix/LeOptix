# What's up?

Hello there!
My nickname is **Optix**, and I am novice developer.
Currently I am learning Web Development and U.E. Blueprints

## Projects?

Yeah, I am part of a bunch of projects, like for example

- **AvdanOS** - _Worflow, reimagined._
- **Nebula** - A brand new Discord bot.
- **Project Leno** - _Made by gamers, for gamers._ `(Non open-source, btw)`

## What am I working on?

On a lot of cool things, and soon I will release all of them. For now, I will just leave here two names:
***Revo*** & ***Optix Arts***.

### Cya!
